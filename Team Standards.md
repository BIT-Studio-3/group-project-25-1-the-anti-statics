# Team Standards
 
**1. Team Unity**
We shall all work as team, and ensure everyone is supported and on the same path.
 
**2. Keep infomred** 
Please let your team know what your doing, and what you're about to do, this is to ensure once again everyone is on the same path.
 
**3. Finished over unfinished**
Having a finished project, is better than having several unfinished features
 
**4. People first!** 
Team members should be valued rather than strictly following to set rules.
 
**5. Intermin Scrum Master** 
If someone selected as scrum master, is off for a period of time, some one else will have to volunteer to be the scrum master in the interim.
 
**6. Customer Satisfaction** 
Keep the customer happy and get regular feedback, so we know our project is meeting their needs.
